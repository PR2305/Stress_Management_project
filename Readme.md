**Stress Management Project using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Stress Management System utilizing Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The system is designed to help individuals manage their stress levels effectively through data-driven insights and personalized recommendations.

## Project Features

1. **User Profile Creation:**
   - Users can create profiles providing basic information like age, gender, and occupation.
   
2. **Stress Assessment:**
   - ML algorithms analyze user inputs and behavioral patterns to assess stress levels.
   
3. **Data Collection:**
   - Collects data from various sources, such as wearable devices, social media, and health apps, to gain insights into the user's lifestyle.
   
4. **Emotion Recognition:**
   - AI algorithms analyze user's facial expressions and voice tone to recognize emotions, providing real-time feedback.
   
5. **Personalized Recommendations:**
   - ML algorithms generate personalized stress management techniques based on the user's profile and assessment results.
   
6. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:**
   - Provides guided meditation sessions, breathing exercises, and stress-relief activities tailored to the user's preferences.
   
7. **Progress Tracking:**
   - Allows users to track their stress levels over time and monitors the effectiveness of the suggested techniques.
   
8. **Alerts and Reminders:**
   - Sends notifications for relaxation exercises, medication reminders, and stress-reducing activities.
   
9. **Data Security:**
   - Ensures user data privacy and security through encryption and secure storage practices.
